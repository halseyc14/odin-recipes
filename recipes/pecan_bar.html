    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pecan pie was meant to be in pie form. Not bar form. Get this away from me. Why is this even on my blog.
        Ridiculous. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup margarine</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons margarine, melted</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups chopped pecans</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10x15-inch jellyroll pan.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt. Cut in 1 cup of margarine until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the prepared pan, and press in firmly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>
        <li>While the crust is baking, prepare the filling. In a large bowl mix together the eggs, corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons margarine, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the chopped pecans. Spread the filling evenly over the crust as soon as it comes out of the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until set. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before slicing into bars.</li>
    </ol>
